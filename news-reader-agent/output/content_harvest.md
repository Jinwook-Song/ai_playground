# News Articles Collection: {topic}

I’m ready to collect recent news articles, but you didn’t specify the topic. Please provide the specific topic (for example: "OpenAI GPT-4o launch", "US debt ceiling negotiations", "Apple iPhone 17", "Ukraine counteroffensive", "AI regulation in EU", etc.).

Before I start, confirm the following (reply with your choices or any additional instructions):
- Exact topic or search terms:
- Time window (default: last 48 hours): 
- Preferred sources or excluded sources (optional): 
- Region or language preference (default: global, English): 
- Max number of articles desired (default: 10): 
- Any special focus (e.g., only investigative pieces, official government sources, research papers)?

Once you confirm the topic and preferences I will:
1. Search for recent articles matching the topic.
2. Filter out topic hubs, tag/index pages and any article older than your time window.
3. Scrape full article pages (title, source, publication date, full article text).
4. Exclude short articles (<200 words) and failed scrapes.
5. Classify each article (Tech, Politics, Business, Science, Health, Sports, International, etc.).
6. Assign credibility (1–10) and relevance (1–10) scores.
7. Return a Markdown document exactly in the required format:
   - Header with collection summary (counts, queries, timestamp)
   - Full scraped content for each accepted article with metadata and classification.

Reply with the topic and preferences and I’ll begin.
