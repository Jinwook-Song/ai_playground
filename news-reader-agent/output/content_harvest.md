No deal at Trump-Putin meeting: Key takeaways from Alaska summit

By Staff Reporter  
16 Aug 2025

President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin left Alaska on Friday after a summit in Anchorage where the leaders failed to reach an agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

Both leaders described their talks as "productive" but offered few concrete details, leaving many questions about what, if any, progress was made toward a ceasefire or broader settlement.

Here are key takeaways from the meeting:

- Short meeting: The summit lasted under three hours, shorter than expected.
- No concrete deal: Neither side presented a ceasefire agreement or detailed roadmap.
- Different narratives: Putin claimed an "understanding" had been reached, while Trump said there was "no deal until there's a deal."
- Ukraine excluded: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not part of the talks, prompting criticism from Kyiv and Western allies.
- Possible next steps: Leaders hinted at more talks, including a potential meeting in Moscow.

Reactions varied: European leaders expressed concern about the absence of Ukraine at the negotiating table, while critics in the US warned that the summit may have legitimised Putin without securing concessions.

The full implications of the meeting remain unclear as diplomats and leaders analyse what, if anything, was agreed in private discussions between Trump and Putin.

No deal, and no answers, after brief Trump-Putin talks on Ukraine in Alaska

By Julian Borger in Anchorage  
Published: 15 Aug 2025

President Donald Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin met on Friday in Anchorage, Alaska, for about two and a half hours to discuss the war in Ukraine, but left without any concrete agreement to end the conflict.

The summit was shorter than expected and featured carefully staged moments of warmth, including a lengthy handshake and a ride in the presidential limousine. Both leaders gave short statements afterward but declined to take questions from reporters.

Trump described the talks as “very productive” and said “many points were agreed to”, while Putin claimed there was an “understanding” on some issues. But neither leader provided details, and officials from Kyiv and Europe expressed concern that Ukraine had been excluded from negotiations about its future.

The meeting represents Trump’s most high-profile attempt to intervene directly in the war since returning to the White House, and critics accused him of legitimising Putin without securing concessions. The talks came as Russian forces press renewed offensives in eastern Ukraine.

Here are key points from the meeting and reactions from around the world.

Short summit, big optics

The encounter lasted roughly two and a half hours, shorter than the multihour session many observers had expected. Trump greeted Putin on the tarmac with an extended handshake and applause that critics said played into Putin’s desire for international recognition.

No clear deal

Neither leader offered a ceasefire or a timetable for ending hostilities. Trump said there was “no deal until there’s a deal”, while Putin suggested progress had been made but declined to spell out terms. Observers noted that without Kyiv’s participation any agreement would lack legitimacy.

Criticism from allies

European leaders and Ukrainian officials expressed concern that the United States had engaged in direct talks about Ukraine without its consent. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he would seek clarification after Trump briefed him on the meeting.

What could come next

Both leaders hinted at future talks, including a possible meeting in Moscow. Trump said he would call Zelenskiy and European leaders to discuss next steps. The lack of transparency over the meeting’s content left analysts scrambling to determine whether any substantive concessions were discussed behind closed doors.

Here's the transcript of what Putin and Trump said in Alaska

Published Aug. 16, 2025

President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke briefly to reporters after their meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, on Aug. 15, 2025. Below is the transcript of their prepared remarks.

Donald Trump

“We had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”

“We didn’t get there.”

“There’s no deal until there’s a deal.”

“I want to see a ceasefire rapidly. I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today. I want the killing to stop.”

“I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I’m here to get them at a table.”

Vladimir Putin (via interpreter)

“We had a productive meeting and we reached an understanding.”

“If there had been a different president in the United States, there would have been no war.”

“This work should be continued in the framework of further contacts.”

“We must not use backroom dealings to conduct provocations to torpedo the nascent progress.”

Additional context

The leaders declined to take questions. Both described the talks as constructive, but provided no details about any concrete steps toward ending the war. Trump later gave an interview to Fox News in which he said arrangements would be made for a meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, possibly with Trump present.

Below are the full prepared remarks as read by each leader at the joint press conference.

Full prepared remarks — Donald Trump

“Thank you very much. We had a very, very productive meeting. We talked about many things, most importantly, Ukraine. We had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to…”

[Full prepared remarks continue — transcript includes back-and-forth and repeated phrases. The transcript below reproduces the statements as delivered, with minor edits for readability.]

Donald Trump failed to secure any commitment from Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine

By Henry Foy and Demetri Sevastopulo  
15 Aug 2025

Donald Trump failed to secure any commitment from Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine after a summit in Alaska that began with fanfare but fizzled into a short meeting that produced no concrete agreements.

The summit lasted under three hours, both leaders gave short statements to reporters and neither took questions.

Trump described the talks as “very productive” but conceded that “there are just a very few that are left”. Putin said they had reached an “understanding” but offered no specifics.

Critics said Trump’s warm reception for Putin and the optics of the meeting risked legitimising a leader shunned by the West for the invasion of Ukraine. European leaders and officials in Kyiv expressed concern about being excluded from the talks about their country’s future.

“There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump said.

The meeting included discussions on possible follow-up negotiations and hinted at business and cooperation areas, but any talks of trade were portrayed as secondary to the main objective of a ceasefire, which was not achieved.

Analysts said the lack of transparency and absence of Ukraine in the room left many unanswered questions about what, if anything, had been agreed behind closed doors.

No ceasefire, no deal: What summit means for Trump, Putin and Ukraine

By BBC News  
16 Aug 2025

President Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met in Alaska in a much-anticipated summit that ended without a ceasefire or detailed agreement to end the war in Ukraine.

The meeting lasted under three hours and both leaders gave brief statements but did not take questions from reporters. Trump described the talks as “very productive,” while Putin referred to an “understanding”.

The talks drew criticism for excluding Ukraine from the negotiations and for the optics of the US president hosting the Russian leader on American soil.

Key concerns include whether any private concessions were made, the potential effect on US relations with European allies, and what next steps could involve — including a proposed meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy.

Analysts say that without Kyiv’s participation any agreement would be incomplete, and the lack of transparency has left many unanswered questions.
