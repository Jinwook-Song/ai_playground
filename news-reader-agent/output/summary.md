# News Summaries: Request for Topic / URLs
**Summary Report Overview** - Total articles processed: 0 - Summary generation date: 2025-08-16

Iâ€™m ready to scrape articles and produce the multi-tier summaries in the exact format you requested, but I donâ€™t yet have the URLs or topic details from the "previous task." Please confirm the inputs below so I can proceed.

Before I start, please provide or confirm the following (reply with your choices or paste URLs):

- Exact topic or search terms (if you want me to search instead of using provided URLs):  
  - Example: `OpenAI GPT-4o launch` or `US debt ceiling negotiations`  
  - If you prefer to supply specific article URLs, paste them here (one per line).

- Time window (default: last 48 hours):  
  - Provide a range (e.g., last 24 hours, last 7 days, specific dates YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD).

- Preferred sources or excluded sources (optional):  
  - Example: include Reuters, NYT; exclude tabloid sites.

- Region or language preference (default: global, English):  
  - Example: `US & EU, English`, or `Global, English`.

- Max number of articles desired (default: 10).

- Any special focus (optional):  
  - Examples: investigative pieces only, official government sources, research papers, op-eds excluded, etc.

- Do you want me to:
  - (A) Use the URLs from the previous task (paste them here), or
  - (B) Perform a live search for the topic and select/scrape articles for you?

What I will do once you confirm:
1. Search (if requested) and/or accept your URLs.
2. Filter out topic hubs, tag/index pages and articles older than your time window.
3. Scrape full article pages (title, source, publication date, full article text, metadata).
4. Exclude short pieces (<200 words) and failed scrapes.
5. Classify each article (Tech, Politics, Business, Science, Health, Sports, International, etc.).
6. Assign credibility (1â€“10) and relevance (1â€“10) scores.
7. Produce a Markdown document exactly in the required format:
   - Header with collection summary (counts, queries, timestamp)
   - For each article: full scraped content with metadata and the three summary tiers:
     - ðŸ“± Headline Summary (â‰¤280 chars)
     - ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary (150â€“200 words)
     - ðŸ“– Comprehensive Summary (500â€“700 words)
   - Summary Quality Metrics and other metadata

Notes and constraints:
- If you want the full scraped article content included in the output (as required), confirm â€” I will include full text blocks for each article.
- Scraping live pages may occasionally fail for paywalled content or blocked sites; Iâ€™ll flag those and propose alternatives.
- Estimated turnaround: after you provide inputs, Iâ€™ll fetch and return up to the specified max articles. For up to 5 articles, expect results within ~3â€“6 minutes; larger batches take longer.

Please reply with your chosen topic/search terms or paste the article URLs and any preferences. Once you do, I will begin scraping and produce the full multi-tier summaries in the exact format you requested.
