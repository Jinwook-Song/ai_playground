       " 'recipe_steps': 'Recipe: Classic Pepperoni Margherita-Style Pizza\\nYields: 1 pizza (one dough ball, about 10–12\" / 25–30 cm)\\nPrep time: 15–30 minutes (plus 30–60 minutes if you bring dough to room temperature)\\nCook time: 8–12 minutes\\nTotal time: 23–102 minutes depending on dough temperature\\n\\nIngredients\\n- 1 ball pizza dough (about 10–12\" pizza)\\n- 1/2 cup tomato sauce\\n- 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella\\n- 1 tablespoon olive oil\\n- 1/2 teaspoon salt\\n- 8 fresh basil leaves\\n- 12 pepperoni slices\\n\\nEquipment suggestions: pizza stone or baking steel (or an inverted baking sheet), pizza peel or flat baking sheet, oven, pizza cutter.\\n\\nInstructions\\n1. Bring dough to room temperature\\n   - If refrigerated, remove dough 30–60 minutes before shaping so it relaxes and is easy to stretch.\\n\\n2. Preheat oven\\n   - Place a pizza stone or steel on the middle/top rack and preheat to 475–500°F (245–260°C) for at least 30 minutes. If using a regular baking sheet, preheat oven to 450°F (230°C).\\n\\n3. Shape the dough\\n   - Lightly flour your work surface. Press and stretch the dough into a roughly 10–12\" circle, leaving a slightly thicker rim for the crust. Avoid overworking so it stays airy.\\n\\n4. Oil and salt the crust\\n   - Brush the outer rim lightly with about 1 teaspoon of the olive oil and sprinkle a pinch of the salt on the crust. This gives a nice golden, seasoned edge.\\n\\n5. Add sauce and cheese\\n   - Spread the 1/2 cup tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the rim clear. Sprinkle the 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella evenly over the sauce.\\n\\n6. Add pepperoni\\n   - Distribute the 12 pepperoni slices evenly over the cheese.\\n\\n7. Bake\\n   - Transfer the pizza to the preheated stone/steel (use a peel or inverted baking sheet). Bake 8–12 minutes at 475–500°F (245–260°C) until the crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and slightly browned. If using a baking sheet, bake 10–15 minutes at 450°F (230°C).\\n\\n8. Finish with basil and oil\\n   - Remove pizza from oven. Immediately scatter the 8 fresh basil leaves on top and drizzle remaining olive oil (or use the rest to lightly finish the crust). Sprinkle any remaining salt lightly over the pizza, tasting carefully.\\n\\n9. Slice and serve\\n   - Let rest 1–2 minutes, then slice and serve hot.\\n\\nTips and variations\\n- For a crispier bottom, use a pizza steel and cook at the highest safe oven temperature. Preheat the steel at least 45 minutes.\\n- If you like the basil more cooked, put a few leaves on before baking and the rest on after.\\n- Add red pepper flakes, grated Parmesan, or a light drizzle of balsamic glaze after baking for extra flavor.\\n- If using frozen dough, thaw in the refrigerator overnight and then bring to room temperature before shaping.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade pepperoni-mozzarella pizza with fresh basil!',\n",
       " 'plating_instructions': 'Here are practical plating and presentation ideas for the 10–12\" Classic Pepperoni Margherita-Style Pizza, with step-by-step finishing and three different serving styles (casual, elevated, and party). Use what suits the occasion.\\n\\nQuick finishing steps (applies to all styles)\\n- After baking, rest 1–2 minutes on the peel/stone so cheese sets slightly.  \\n- Scatter the fresh basil leaves immediately (or tear some into a chiffonade for a lighter look).  \\n- Drizzle the remaining olive oil lightly over the crust and top; finish with a few flakes of sea salt to taste.  \\n- Slice with a pizza cutter or large chef’s knife into 6–8 wedges.\\n\\nPlating style 1 — Casual / family-style (what most home cooks will use)\\n- Transfer the whole pizza to a wooden pizza peel or large wooden board roughly the same size. A round or long rectangular board works.  \\n- Leave the pizza whole on the board and bring the board to the table. This feels rustic and convivial.  \\n- Optionally scatter 2–3 extra torn basil leaves on top for color.  \\n- Place small ramekins with chili flakes, grated Parmesan, and extra olive oil or marinara alongside the board.  \\n- Provide a pizza server or spatula and a pizza cutter at the table so guests can serve themselves.\\n\\nPlating style 2 — Elevated / restaurant-style single plate\\n- Choose a large white or matte plate (11–12\" for a 10–12\" pizza: you can present 2–3 slices per plate) or a slightly larger charger if serving a whole pizza family-style. Light plates give good color contrast with red sauce and green basil.  \\n- Place 2–3 slices slightly overlapping in a fan pattern, crusts aligned at the outer edge of the plate so the golden rim is visible.  \\n- Drizzle a thin line of olive oil or a very light balsamic glaze across the tips of the slices (not the entire pizza—keep it minimal).  \\n- Garnish with a small basil chiffonade or 1–2 whole basil leaves on top, and a light grind of black pepper and a dusting of grated Parmesan at the edge.  \\n- Wipe any stray sauce or crumbs from the rim of the plate before serving.\\n\\nPlating style 3 — Party / buffet\\n- Pre-slice the pizza into 8 thin wedges. Arrange slices in overlapping rows on a long, shallow tray or large rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment.  \\n- Alternate slice orientation so pepperoni faces up and looks appealing. Space slightly for people to grab slices easily.  \\n- Place small bowls of condiments (hot honey, chili flakes, grated Parmesan, extra basil) nearby and tongs or heat-resistant spatulas for pickup.  \\n- Keep pizza covered loosely with foil for a short time if you need to hold it; remove cover just before guests arrive.\\n\\nFinishing touches and small details that elevate the look\\n- Color contrast: use a light or dark board/plate opposite the pizza color for pop (white or dark slate are favorites).  \\n- Texture: brush the crust with oil for shine and sprinkle flaky sea salt on the rim so the edge looks appetizing.  \\n- Aroma: tearing basil releases aroma—torn leaves scattered just before serving read as fresh.  \\n- Height & movement: fan slices or stack two for visual interest. Leave one slice slightly pulled away from the pie to show the cheesy pull.  \\n- Portioning: for a 10–12\" pizza, plan 2–3 slices per adult as a main, or 1–2 as part of a multi-course meal.\\n\\nUtensils & service\\n- Provide a pizza cutter or pre-slice and provide tongs/pizza server.  \\n- Napkins and small plates for casual service; dinner plates and forks if you prefer a sit-down feel.\\n\\nExample final garnish amounts for this pizza\\n- 2–4 torn basil leaves added after baking (plus the 8 whole leaves called for in the recipe if you like).  \\n- Light drizzle (about 1–2 teaspoons) extra olive oil over the finished pizza.  \\n- Pinch of flaky sea salt and optional 1–2 tablespoons grated Parmesan for sprinkling at service.\\n\\nThat’s it — choose the presentation that matches your occasion: rustic board for casual, precise plating for special dinners, or pre-sliced trays for gatherings. Enjoy!'}"
