        <h2>Why CPR training matters — who should take it</h2>
        <p>
          Most out-of-hospital cardiac arrests happen at home. Bystander CPR can
          double or triple survival — so family members, coworkers, teachers,
          fitness staff, childcare providers, and lifeguards all benefit from
          training. Employers often require Heartsaver or BLS depending on risk.
          Parents and caregivers should prioritize pediatric CPR. Hands-only CPR
          reduces hesitation for untrained rescuers and is recommended for adult
          sudden cardiac arrest.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>
          Top clinical takeaways — what to do in an arrest (quick, actionable)
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Rate:</strong> 100–120 compressions per minute (use the song
            Stayin' Alive or a metronome).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Depth:</strong> at least 2 in (5 cm) for adults; roughly 1/3
            chest depth for children; ~1.5 in for infants.
          </li>
          <li>Allow full chest recoil and minimize interruptions.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compression/ventilation (trained):</strong> 30:2 for single
            rescuer adult CPR.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hands-only CPR for untrained bystanders:</strong> call 911,
            push hard and fast in center of chest until help arrives.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use an AED as soon as available — turn on, attach pads, and follow
            voice prompts; do not touch the person during analysis/shock.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are the essential metrics reinforced in every quality Heartsaver
          or BLS class.

          <li>
            Check responsiveness and breathing. If unresponsive and not
            breathing or gasping → CALL 911 (or tell someone to).
          </li>
          <li>
            Start chest compressions: center of chest, 100–120/min, ~2 in (5 cm)
            adult depth.
          </li>
          <li>
            If trained: 30 compressions then 2 breaths. If not: continue
            hands-only compressions.
          </li>
          <li>Use AED immediately when available; follow prompts.</li>
          <li>
            Continue until advanced help arrives or the person shows signs of
            life.

          <li>
            <strong>Heartsaver CPR AED:</strong> For lay rescuers and many
            workplaces. Covers adult CPR, AED use, and choking relief. Typical
            length 2–4 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>BLS (Basic Life Support):</strong> For healthcare providers
            and clinical staff; includes team dynamics and CPR across ages.
            In-person skills check required for full certification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pediatric CPR:</strong> For parents and childcare providers
            — infant/child techniques and choking relief.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blended courses:</strong> Online knowledge + in-person
            skills session (best balance of convenience + verified skills).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note: For workplace compliance, confirm your employer's accepted
          providers (AHA, Red Cross, or local accredited centers).

          How to train so you’ll perform well under stress (skills that stick)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Training that transfers uses feedback devices, scenario practice, and
          frequent short refreshers. Practical tips:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use feedback manikins to learn correct depth and rate; practice
            2-minute cycles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run scenarios that include calling 911, assigning roles, and AED use
            to reduce hesitation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Microlearning: 5–15 minute refreshers every 3–6 months preserve
            psychomotor skills better than annual-only practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Team drills: practice single rescuer vs team rescuer roles and clear
            communication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Psychological readiness: rehearse the decision to act; practice
            dispatcher-assisted calls in scenarios.
          </li>

        <h2>Tools & special situations (what instructors cover)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Feedback-enabled manikins and smartphone apps for real-time
            depth/rate scoring.
          </li>
          <li>
            AED trainers for realistic device practice (no shock delivered).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pediatric differences:</strong> different hand techniques
            and depth — take a pediatric course if you care for children.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drowning/respiratory arrests:</strong> prioritize
            ventilations; follow instructor guidance for ventilation vs
            compression priorities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Opioid overdose:</strong> rescue breaths are critical if
            breathing is absent; naloxone if trained and available.

        <h2>FAQ — answers people search for</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: What is hands-only CPR?</strong><br />
          A: Hands-only CPR means chest compressions only: call 911, push hard
          and fast in the center of the chest at 100–120/min until help arrives.
          Recommended for untrained bystanders for adult sudden cardiac arrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: Which CPR course do I need for work?</strong><br />
          A: Check your employer: many require Heartsaver for lay staff, and BLS
          for clinical staff. Verify accepted providers before registering.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: How long does CPR certification last?</strong><br />
          A: Most certifications are valid 1–2 years — confirm renewal
          requirements with your provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: Can I get certified fully online?</strong><br />
          A: Many providers offer the knowledge portion online but require an
          in-person skills check for full certification accepted by employers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Q: Where can I find AEDs in public?</strong><br />
          A: Check municipal AED registries, venue maps, and AED mapping apps;
          train with AED trainer devices in class.
