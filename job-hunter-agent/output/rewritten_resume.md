Please share the following so I can deliver a fully rewritten, job-targeted Markdown resume:

1. **Your current resume** (or a detailed summary) including:
   - Contact information (name, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub if any)  
   - Professional summary or objective (if present)  
   - Work experience (company names, roles, dates, bullet points)  
   - Education  
   - Technical skills (languages, frameworks, tools)  
   - Projects, certifications, publications (if relevant)

2. **The selected job opportunity** (“ChosenJob”) details:
   - Job title and level (e.g., Senior Software Engineer)  
   - Company name (optional)  
   - Location (city/region or remote)  
   - Full job description or key responsibilities and requirements  
   - Any specific keywords or skills emphasized in the posting  

Once I have those, I’ll produce a Markdown-formatted resume rewrite that:
- Highlights and reorders your top achievements and skills  
- Uses the exact keywords and tone from the job posting  
- Ensures ATS compliance with clear headings and bullet points  
- Retains your real experiences and refrains from adding any false details  

Looking forward to your resume and job details!
