I’m ready to deliver a full Markdown company-and-role deep dive—but I need the **ChosenJob** details first. Please share:

1. **Job title & level** (e.g., Senior Software Engineer)  
2. **Company name**  
3. **Location** (city/region or remote)  
4. **Full job description** or key responsibilities & requirements  

Once I have those, I'll research the company and return the complete Markdown with:

## Company Overview  
## Mission and Values  
## Recent News or Changes  
## Role Context and Product Involvement  
## Likely Interview Topics  
## Suggested Questions to Ask
