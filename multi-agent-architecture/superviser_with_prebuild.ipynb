      "The Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815) was the decisive engagement that ended Napoleon Bonaparte’s rule and brought the Napoleonic Wars to a close. It was fought near the village of Waterloo in what was then the United Kingdom of the Netherlands (today’s Belgium), about 13 km south of Brussels. The two main allied commanders were the Duke of Wellington (Arthur Wellesley), leading a British-led coalition of British, Dutch-Belgian, Hanoverian, Brunswick and Nassau troops, and Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. Napoleon commanded the French forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context\n",
      "- After escaping exile on Elba in March 1815, Napoleon returned to power for the “Hundred Days.” The allied powers mobilized to remove him. Napoleon sought to defeat the allied armies in detail before their full forces could combine: he moved against Wellington’s Anglo-allied army and the Prussian army separately, hoping to prevent their junction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Forces (approximate)\n",
      "- French: ~70–75,000 men.\n",
      "- Anglo-allied: ~60–70,000 men (a mixed multinational force).\n",
      "- Prussian army: ~50–60,000 men in the theater, but Prussian corps arrived progressively during the battle.\n",
      "(Estimates vary among historians; these are typical rounded figures.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Course of the battle (major phases)\n",
      "- Morning–early fighting: Napoleon attacked Wellington’s position on the ridge south of Waterloo. Torrential rain the preceding night left the ground sodden; Napoleon delayed a full-scale assault until the ground had dried enough for artillery and cavalry to operate effectively.\n",
      "- Hougoumont: A fortified farmhouse complex on Wellington’s right flank saw heavy fighting throughout the day. French attacks there failed to break the position but tied down troops.\n",
      "- Midday–afternoon: French assaults focused on the Allied center and on La Haye Sainte (a farmhouse in front of the center). French infantry captured La Haye Sainte late in the afternoon, but the Allied line held on the ridge.\n",
      "- Prussian arrival: Blücher’s Prussian corps, having disengaged from Marshal Grouchy (who had been sent by Napoleon to pursue them), began arriving on Napoleon’s right flank in the late afternoon. Prussian pressure was decisive in stretching and breaking the French lines.\n",
      "- Evening: Marshal Ney led repeated cavalry charges against Allied squares but with limited infantry and artillery support; these attacks were repulsed. Around early evening the Imperial Guard made a final assault; Wellington’s troops and the advancing Prussians repulsed them. The French line then broke into rout.\n",
      "- Pursuit: After the French collapse, the Allies and Prussians pressed the pursuit; the French army disintegrated as an effective fighting force.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key command and operational issues\n",
      "- Marshal Grouchy, commanding a sizeable French force, had been sent to prevent Prussian intervention but failed to stop Blücher’s move to Waterloo; his actions remain a critical and much-debated factor in Napoleon’s defeat.\n",
      "- Wellington’s defensive use of the reverse slope (deploying much of his infantry just over the crest) reduced the effectiveness of French artillery and helped preserve morale under heavy assault.\n",
      "- Weather and muddy ground delayed and limited French artillery and cavalry effectiveness early in the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Casualties and losses\n",
      "- Estimates vary. Typical modern summaries place total casualties (killed, wounded, missing/captured) in the range of roughly 40,000–50,000 across both sides combined. Common approximate breakdowns are French around 20,000–25,000 and allied (British-led plus Prussian) around 20,000–25,000. Precise figures differ by source.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aftermath and significance\n",
      "- Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo ended his rule: he abdicated for the second time a few days later (22 June) and surrendered to the British in July; he was exiled to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.\n",
      "- The victory ensured the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France and led to the second Treaty of Paris (1815), which was harsher than the earlier 1814 settlement.\n",
      "- Waterloo marked the end of large-scale Napoleonic expansion and helped inaugurate a period of relative stability in Europe dominated by the Concert of Europe and the decisions of the Congress of Vienna.\n",
      "- Culturally and politically, “Waterloo” became synonymous with a final, crushing defeat; the battle has inspired extensive memoirs, histories, paintings (notably by Turners and others), and ongoing scholarly debate about tactics, responsibility, and contingency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historiographical notes\n",
      "- Historians continue to debate the extent to which Napoleon’s strategic choices, Grouchy’s conduct, Wellington’s defensive skill, Blücher’s determination, weather, and chance each contributed to the outcome. The interplay of those factors—and the multinational character of the Allied force—remains central to interpretations of the battle.\n",

      "Alexander III of Macedon (commonly called Alexander the Great) was a king of Macedon who created one of the largest empires of the ancient world and whose campaigns spread Greek culture across much of the Near East and Central Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key facts\n",
      "- Born 356 BCE in Pella (capital of Macedon); son of King Philip II and Olympias.\n",
      "- Tutored in youth by the philosopher Aristotle.\n",
      "- Became king in 336 BCE after Philip’s assassination, at about age 20.\n",
      "- Led a decade-plus series of campaigns (334–323 BCE) that toppled the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire and extended his rule from Greece and Egypt through Anatolia, the Levant, Mesopotamia, Persia, and into Central Asia and the northwestern Indian subcontinent.\n",
      "- Major battles: Granicus (334 BCE), Issus (333 BCE), Gaugamela (331 BCE, decisive defeat of Darius III), and Hydaspes (326 BCE against King Porus in the Indus basin).\n",
      "- Founded many cities named Alexandria (the most famous in Egypt), encouraging Greek settlement and administration; in Egypt he was recognized as a pharaoh and founded the city of Alexandria (c. 331 BCE).\n",
      "- Adopted some Persian court practices and arranged mass marriages at Susa (324 BCE) between his officers and Persian noblewomen to bind Macedonian and Persian elites.\n",
      "- Married Roxana (a Sogdian/Bactrian noblewoman) and took other Persian royal wives in his policy of fusion; his only legitimate posthumous heir, Alexander IV, was born after his death.\n",
      "- Died in Babylon in 323 BCE at about age 32. Causes are uncertain and debated (fever from disease such as malaria or typhoid, pancreatitis, or, less likely among modern scholars, poisoning).\n",
      "\n",
      "Aftermath and legacy\n",
      "- Alexander left no strong, institutionalized succession plan; his sudden death produced a power vacuum. His generals (the Diadochi) fought over his territories, eventually dividing the empire into Hellenistic kingdoms (notably the Ptolemaic kingdom in Egypt and the Seleucid realm in Asia).\n",
      "- His conquests accelerated the spread of Greek language, art, urban institutions, and ideas across the eastern Mediterranean and Near East — a cultural transformation known as Hellenization. This fusion shaped the Hellenistic world and influenced Roman and later Western and Middle Eastern civilizations.\n",
      "- Alexander’s life became the subject of legend and literary portraiture; ancient sources include Arrian, Plutarch, Diodorus Siculus, Curtius Rufus and Justin. Modern historians debate aspects of his motives, methods, and the character of his rule (brilliance and military genius vs. acts of brutality and autocratic tendencies).\n",
      "\n",
      "In short: Alexander was a charismatic and bold Macedonian king and general whose conquests reshaped the political and cultural map of the ancient world and whose legacy endured in the Hellenistic age that followed.\n",
